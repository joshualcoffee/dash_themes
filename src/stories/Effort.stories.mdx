# Easy implementation

## Color Themes

Currently each dashboard card uses a default config to style the charts and graphs.
Instead of using the default config we instead could use a theme context and pass it in to each dashcard.
This would allow us to not only theme charts and graphs but we could also theme all text and other elements withing the dashboard.

Example:

### DashBoard.jsx

```jsx
import styled, { ThemeProvider } from "styled-components";

const theme = {
  barColor: "#0f0080",
  areaBackgroundColor: "#00ff40",
  areaStrokeColor: "#ff00dd",
  yAxisColor: "#ff0008",
  xAxisColor: "#00e1ff",
  primary: "#3700ff",
  seconday: "#51408f",
  accent: "#fcb900",
};

const DashboardTheme = div`
  ${({ theme }) => `
      display: flex;
      .title {
        color: ${theme.primary}
      }
      .paragraph {
        color: ${theme.secondary}
      }
      a {
        color: ${theme.accent}
      }
    `}
`;

const DashBoard = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <DashboardTheme>...</DashboardTheme>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

### ExampleDashCard.jsx

```jsx
const ExampleDashCard = ({ theme }) => {
  return (
    <ComposedChart width={800} height={300} data={data}>
      <XAxis stroke={theme.xAxisColor} dataKey="start_date" />
      <YAxis
        stroke={theme.yAxisColor}
        yAxisId="left"
        axisLine={false}
        tickLine={false}
      />
      <YAxis
        stroke={theme.yAxisColor}
        yAxisId="right"
        orientation="right"
        axisLine={false}
        tickLine={false}
      />
      <Bar fill={theme.barColor} yAxisId="left" dataKey="totals.spend" />
      <Area
        stroke={theme.areaStrokeColor}
        fill={theme.areaBackgroundColor}
        yAxisId="right"
        dataKey="totals.leads"
        type="monotone"
      />
    </ComposedChart>
  );
};
```

The dashcard will inerit the theme that we are passing in to the dashboard.

## Benefits

- It's relatively easy to add refactor each dashcard to accept a theme.
- Could be done within one sprint
- Allows us to keep the same source in place

## Issues

- Researching this I found that the dashcards are tightly coupled to their own isolated layout.
  It would be very hard to retheme the dashcards. We are looing at and entire refactor for all dashcards if we need to do this.
- We cannot easily change the footer or header in the PDF as they are added on within the PDF builder.
- The way we handle the print style-sheet could cause issues when refactoring to allow layouts.
