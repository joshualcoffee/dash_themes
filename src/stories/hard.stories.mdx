# Harder implementation

## Custom layouts

At the moment we cannot easily refactor the dashcard to support multiple layouts.
We would essentially need to create multiple versions of each dashcard to allow custom layouts.
This would also be complicated to maintain in the future as we would need to support each version of the layout.

## Proposed solution

- Utilize spectacle
- Allow users to create custom layouts for each dashcard in their presentation via a layout builder. (https://craft.js.org/ or similar)
- or have multiple layouts for each type of dashcard that the user can use.
- Allow users to mix and match data. Example: have the gender chart with the CTR donut chart side by side.

## Benefits

- Allows more customization
- Can utilize existing charts and graphs.
- Uses spectacle so you could also have a presentation that could be sent to users. Allowing a more dynamic experience.
- Spectacle allows you to export presentations as PDF's

## Issues

- Will require much more time to develop
- Completely changes the way we are exporting PDF's.
- Requires users to implement the custom layouts.
